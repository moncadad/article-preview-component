## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Made proper use of semantic element tags.
Better understood how to implement "wrapper".
Sort of understand how to use position and how to counter margins with negative numbers. Not sure why, but whatever works.
Made good use off toggle classList in javascript.
Overall kept my code nice, clean, making it easy to understand!

Proud of this little bit, and the pairing css the "active" class altered.

```js
function shareHandle() {
  console.log("share clicked");
  footerSection.classList.toggle("active");
}
```

### Continued development

Top 3 things I would like to better understand is css-positioning, html-semantic markup and better bem, and javascript as a whole.
Oh, and more libraries/ frameworks. The better I understand existing tools the better of a developer I can become ðŸ˜Š.

### Useful resources
